      <h2>Nature of the experience</h2>
      <p>
        Santa Hotline provides short, pre‑recorded, festive video call experiences featuring
        characters such as Santa, Mrs. Claus, elves, a snowman, and a reindeer. Calls are
        simulated for entertainment purposes only. The app does not provide live communications
        with real people and is not a telecommunications service.
      </p>
      <p>
        For a summary of features, see the marketing page at
        <a href="/index.html">santahotlineapp/index.html</a>.

      <h2>Privacy and data handling</h2>
      <p>
        The app is designed for families and children and does not collect, store, or share
        personal data. Camera and microphone access are used only for on‑device, real‑time
        preview during the simulated call; nothing is recorded or saved. For full details,
        please review our <a href="/privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>.

        We recommend that parents or guardians supervise use by young children and ensure
        the device is used safely and appropriately. The app contains no ads or in‑app
        purchases and avoids collection of personal information.
