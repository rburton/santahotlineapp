    <p><strong>App:</strong> Santa Hotline (iOS)</p>
    <p><strong>Effective date:</strong> November 24, 2025</p>

      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <p>
        Santa Hotline is designed for families and children and places privacy and safety first.
        The app does not collect, store, or share personal data. There are no ads, no analytics,
        no tracking technologies, no cookies, and no third‑party SDKs that profile users.
      </p>
      <p>
        The app requests access to your <strong>camera</strong> and <strong>microphone</strong> solely to show a
        live, on‑device preview during the simulated call experience. <strong>Nothing is recorded, saved,
        transcribed, or transmitted</strong>—the video and audio remain on your device and disappear as soon as
        you close the experience.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>What the app does</h2>
      <p>
        The app provides short, pre‑recorded, festive video call experiences with characters like
        Santa, Mrs. Claus, elves, a snowman, and a reindeer, plus a seasonal countdown. All
        experiences run entirely on‑device.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Data we do not collect</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>No personal information (such as names, emails, phone numbers, ages, or addresses).</li>
        <li>No device identifiers (IDFA, IDFV), IP addresses, or precise location.</li>
        <li>No usage analytics or diagnostics from users.</li>
        <li>No saved photos, videos, audio recordings, or contacts. Live camera/microphone input is processed
          only in real time on-device and is never stored.</li>
        <li>No cookies or similar tracking technologies.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Device access and permissions</h2>
      <p>
        Santa Hotline <strong>requests access to the camera and microphone</strong> so it can display your live video
        and audio locally during the simulated call. This access is used only while the feature is
        active. <strong>No frames or audio are recorded, saved, uploaded, or shared</strong>. If you prefer, you can
        deny these permissions and continue to enjoy the pre‑recorded experiences without the live preview.
      </p>
      <p>
        The app does not request access to contacts, photos, files, precise location, or other sensitive data.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Children’s privacy</h2>
      <p>
        The app is suitable for children and complies with children’s privacy principles by
        avoiding collection of personal data. Because we do not collect any information, there is
        nothing to store, use, or share about a child’s identity or behavior.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Third‑party services</h2>
      <p>
        The app does not integrate third‑party analytics, advertising networks, crash reporters,
        or social plugins. No data is sent to external services for profiling or marketing.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Data storage and retention</h2>
      <p>
        We do not maintain servers for this app and do not store user data on a backend. The app
        does not create cloud backups of any personal information. Consequently, there is no data
        to retain or delete.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Your choices</h2>
      <p>
        As the app does not collect any personal data, there are no settings required to limit data
        collection. You may delete the app at any time.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>International use</h2>
      <p>
        The app functions the same in all regions. Since no personal data is collected, there is no
        cross‑border data transfer.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Changes to this policy</h2>
      <p>
        If we make material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will update this page and modify the
        effective date above. Because the app collects no data, changes are expected to be minimal
        and focused on clarity.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Contact</h2>
      <p>
        If you have questions about this Privacy Policy or the app, please reach out using the
        contact information provided on the Santa Hotline App Store listing or the developer’s
        support channel.
